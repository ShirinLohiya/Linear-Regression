# Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on the number of rooms. It is my first step into the world of Machine Learning, showcasing the application of fundamental ML concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the **median house price** (`medv`) using the **average number of rooms** (`RM`) as a feature. The project leverages Python libraries like `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`,`numpy` to build, evaluate, and visualize the linear regression model.

## Key Features

1. **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**:
   - Exploration of the dataset to understand feature relationships.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for unbiased evaluation.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Training a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`.
   - Visualizing the regression line and the actual data points.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculating performance metrics by:
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **R-squared (RÂ²)**

4. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plot of the actual house prices vs. predicted prices.
   - Overlay of the regression line for better interpretability.
